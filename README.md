# Ares-Extras

# still working on this, so somethings might still not work due to me forgetting something. will be fixing it

This is a collection of unofficial installation scripts for Ares allowing you to quickly and easily install emulators, ports and libretrocores 
These scripts can be considered experimental at best.

Most of the scripts do work as is.
Im slowly going through and seeing what i can get working on XU4. 
right now i have a bunch of them that install but will not run due to the lack of OpenGL

First you need to add a line into the sources.list

sudo nano/
